## Accelerated Attributed Network Embedding
Accelerated Attributed Network Embedding, SDM 2017


## Code in MATLAB
```
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d);  
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d,lambda,rho);  
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d,lambda,rho,'Att');  
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d,lambda,rho,'Att',worknum);  
```

- H is the joint embedding representation of Net and Attri;
- Net is the weighted adjacency matrix;
- Attri is the node attribute information matrix with row denotes nodes.
